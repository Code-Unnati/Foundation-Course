# Assignment: Student Grade Sorting and Analysis

## Scenario:
Suppose a teacher needs to grade assignments submitted by students in a class. Each assignment has a numerical score, and the teacher wants to sort the students' grades in ascending order to easily identify the highest and lowest scores, as well as to understand the distribution of grades in the class.

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to simulate the scenario described above by generating random student IDs and their corresponding scores, sorting the students based on their scores using various sorting algorithms, and finally determining the top-performing students and analyzing the grade distribution.

## Tasks:
1. Generate random student IDs and their corresponding scores.
2. Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort algorithms to sort the students based on their scores.
3. Determine the top-performing students with the highest scores.
4. Analyze the grade distribution to understand the range and distribution of scores in the class.
5. Compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms in terms of time complexity and performance for sorting student grades.

## Deliverables:
1. Python program or Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the above tasks.
2. Output displaying the sorted student grades, top-performing students, and grade distribution analysis.
3. Report summarizing the efficiency comparison of sorting algorithms and insights gained from grade distribution analysis.
